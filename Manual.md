# Instruction Manual

## Terminology

Program: There are 12 preset "terrains" that you can cycle on, called "programs". They have a fixed distance that you cycle for, and automatically change the difficulty of pedalling over time to simulate going up/down-hill.

## Interface

### Buttons on the box

- Volume dial: Turn clockwise to increase the volume, anticlockwise to decrease.
- On/Off switch: Flip **down** to start the Audible Appliances application, and flip **up** to stop it. It may take up to 10 seconds before the system starts.

### Buttons on the bike

- Top right: Start/Stop button. This is usually used to begin cycling in some mode (either in a program or in free mode), or to pause your current cycle session.
- Bottom right: Reset button. When the bike is paused, press this to select a program or restart free mode.
- Centre: Dial.
  - When you're cycling, rotating the dial clockwise increases the resistance of the pedals. It's also used to cycle through options in a menu - the bike should say something along the lines of "rotate clockwise to ..." to indicate that this is an option.
  - Pressing the dial in is referred to as "enter" in the prompts from the bike, and is usually used to go a level deeper into a menu.
- Top left: Unused - please don't press this!
- Bottom left: Unused - please don't press this!

## Basic Usage

1. Make sure that both the bike and device are plugged in and turned on at the wall. Also make sure that the speakers are connected and turned on.
2. Flip the on/off switch to the "on" position, and wait for the system to announce that it's turned on.
3. When prompted, press the "start/stop" button to enter free cycle mode.
4. Pause the session by pressing the "start/stop" button.
5. When paused, press the "reset" button to select a cycling mode:
    1. To select the free cycle mode, just hit "start" again immediately.
    2. To select a program, rotate the dial clockwise once, then hit "enter". Then rotating the dial clockwise and anticlockwise will change the program number, and you can press "start" to begin that program.
6. When cycling you can rotate the dial to increase the resistance of the pedals.

The bike can take a second or two to realise that the screen's changed - this is necessary to reduce the likelihood that it thinks you're in a different state to your true one. If in doubt (eg. you've pressed a button but it's not said anything), just wait a few seconds and the bike should update.

## Example Usage

1. You want to just cycle for a while without any of the fuss of choosing a program.

   You can simply turn on the system and press "start" when prompted - you'll then be in the free cycle mode. If you don't want to hear the periodic readouts of your speed and distance covered etc, you can turn the volume down using the dial on the box.

2. You want to cycle on a specific program.

   Turn on the system and press start when prompted, then press start again to pause the bike. Press reset to select a mode, and rotate the dial clockwise to select the "select a program" mode. Press "enter" (push the dial in), then rotate the dial clockwise or anticlockwise to select the program you want to use. Press "start" to begin a program.

3. You're currently cycling on a specific program, and you want to switch to free cycle mode.

   Press the "start/stop" button to pause the session, then hit "reset" to select a mode as above - the first mode option is free cycle, so just hit start to begin the session.

## Configuring the system (technical)

Configuring the system requires access to a laptop or PC with a wireless card. The system broadcasts a WiFi network with SSID "bravo-net" and passphrase "screwdriver".

Upon connecting to the network, enter `192.168.0.1` into a web browser's address bar (or `192.168.0.1:80` if that doesn't work). You should be presented with the website used to configure the device.

You can set the voice used by the system, along with configuring the bounding boxes used by the system to identify key areas of the screen (eg. the locations of LCDs and indicator lights).
