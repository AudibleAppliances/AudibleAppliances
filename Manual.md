### Basic Usage

1. Make sure that both the bike and device are plugged in and turned on at the wall. Also make sure that the speakers are connected and turned on.
2. Press the start button first and wait to see what the bike says.
3. Follow what you hear to set up your cycling session. At any time, the "start/stop" button can be pushed to pause cycling.
4. At any time, you can start again/choose a different program by pressing and holding the reset button.

### Cycling session settings

Multiple programs can be chosen when cycling (there are 12 in total). They all differ in how difficult they make the cycling at different points (however the difficulaty can also be adjusted by turning the wheel while cycling). These can be chosen at the start. There also also an option to choose no program and just cycle freely.
Once cycling, the bike will give updates on how you are cycling. For example calories burned, distance  cycled, and the speed you are cycling at.

If at any point something goes wrong, the bike will continuously tell you. When this happens, press and hold the reset button.
